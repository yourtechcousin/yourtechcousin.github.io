My GitHub account is about learning to properly use open source software and working on my coding skills.
The repository that I created is for my GitHub lab assignment.
On my GitHub desktop, I was able to click the plus symbal and select Clone a repository. I selected my previously created repository. I chose the location in which I wanted it saved and selected clone repository.
